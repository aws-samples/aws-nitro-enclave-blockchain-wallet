# AWS Nitro Enclave with TLS Termination

This pattern represents an example implementation of TLS termination within an AWS Nitro Enclave, i.e., serving an HTTPS web server from within an enclave.

## Deploying the solution with AWS CDK

Deploying the solution with the AWS CDK The AWS CDK is an open-source framework for defining and provisioning cloud
application resources. It uses common programming languages such as JavaScript, C#, and Python.
The [AWS CDK command line interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html) (CLI) allows you to interact
with CDK applications. It provides features like synthesizing AWS CloudFormation templates, confirming the security
changes, and deploying applications.

This section shows how to prepare the environment for running CDK and the sample code. For this walkthrough, you must
have the following prerequisites:

* An [AWS account](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.aws.amazon.com%2Fbilling%2Fsignup%2Fresume&client_id=signup).
* An IAM user with administrator access
* [Configured AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites)
* Installed Node.js, Python 3, and pip. To install the example application:

When working with Python, itâ€™s good practice to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv) to
create project-specific virtual environments. The use of `venv` also reflects AWS CDK standard behavior. You can find
out more in the
workshop [Activating the virtualenv](https://cdkworkshop.com/30-python/20-create-project/200-virtualenv.html).

1. Install the CDK and test the CDK CLI:
    ```bash
    npm install -g aws-cdk && cdk --version
    ```
   
2. Download the code from the GitHub repo and switch in the new directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-nitro-enclave-blockchain-wallet.git && cd aws-nitro-enclave-blockchain-wallet
    ```
3. Install the dependencies using the Python package manager:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Specify the AWS region and account for your deployment:
   ```bash
   export CDK_DEPLOY_REGION=us-east-1
   export CDK_DEPLOY_ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity | jq -r '.Account')
   export CDK_APPLICATION_TYPE=https_web_server
   export CDK_PREFIX=dev
   ```
   You can set the ```CDK_PREFIX``` variable as per your preference.

5. Create the self-signed certificate:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create_certificate.sh
   ```

6. Deploy the example code with the CDK CLI:
    ```bash
    cdk deploy ${CDK_PREFIX}NitroHttpsWebServer
    ```

7. Once the CDK deployment is successfully completed, copy the NLB DNS name from the Outputs section, and open it in a web browser. You will see a warning due to the self-signed certificate, which is expected. Accept and continue.

8. You should be able to see the web page being served from inside the Nitro enclave.

## Cleaning up

Once you have completed the deployment and tested the application, clean up the environment to avoid incurring extra
cost. This command removes all resources in this stack provisioned by the CDK:

```bash
cdk destroy
```
