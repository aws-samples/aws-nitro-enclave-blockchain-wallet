## Deploying the solution with AWS CDK

Deploying the solution with the AWS CDK The AWS CDK is an open-source framework for defining and provisioning cloud
application resources. It uses common programming languages such as JavaScript, C#, and Python.
The [AWS CDK command line interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html) (CLI) allows you to interact
with CDK applications. It provides features like synthesizing AWS CloudFormation templates, confirming the security
changes, and deploying applications.

This section shows how to prepare the environment for running CDK and the sample code. For this walkthrough, you must
have the following prerequisites:

*

An [AWS account](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.aws.amazon.com%2Fbilling%2Fsignup%2Fresume&client_id=signup).

* An IAM user with administrator access
* [Configured AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites)
* Installed Node.js, Python 3, and pip. To install the example application:

When working with Python, itâ€™s good practice to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv) to
create project-specific virtual environments. The use of `venv` also reflects AWS CDK standard behavior. You can find
out more in the
workshop [Activating the virtualenv](https://cdkworkshop.com/30-python/20-create-project/200-virtualenv.html).

1. Install the CDK and test the CDK CLI:
    ```bash
    npm install -g aws-cdk && cdk --version
    ```

2. Download the code from the GitHub repo and switch in the new directory:
    ```bash
    git clone --single-branch --branch feature/rds_integration https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-nitro-enclave-blockchain-wallet.git && cd aws-nitro-enclave-blockchain-wallet
    ```
3. Install the dependencies using the Python package manager:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Specify the AWS region and account for your deployment:
   ```bash
   export CDK_DEPLOY_REGION=us-east-1
   export CDK_DEPLOY_ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity | jq -r '.Account')
   export CDK_APPLICATION_TYPE=rds_integration
   export CDK_PREFIX=dev
   ```
   You can set the ```CDK_PREFIX``` variable as per your preference.

5. Trigger the `kmstool_enclave_cli` build:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build_kmstool_enclave_cli.sh
   ```

6. Trigger the `viproxy` build:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build_vsock_proxy.sh
   ```

7. Deploy the example code with the CDK CLI:
   ```bash
   cdk deploy ${CDK_PREFIX}NitroRdsIntegration
   ``` 

8. The deployment will print out the `devNitroWalletEth.RDSendpoint` parameter. Copy the
   value `devnitrowallet[...]us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com` and
   insert it at the `rds_endpoint_address` placeholder variable in the `nitro_wallet/nitro_rds_integration_stack.py` file.

9. Re-deploy the enclave via:
   ```bash
   cdk deploy ${CDK_PREFIX}NitroRdsIntegration
   ```

10. Get EC2 instance ids by providing the `devNitroWalletEth.ASGGroupName` from the `cdk deploy` output to the script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/get_asg_instances.sh <asg group name>
   ``` 

11. Pick one of the two instance ids and connect to it via AWS System Manager Session Manager (SSM):
   ```bash
   aws ssm start-session --target <EC2 instance id> --region ${CDK_DEPLOY_REGION}
   ```
   Note: If Session Manager plugin is not installed, you can install it by following this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html).

12. Change to `ec2-user` and attach to the enclave debug output:
   ```bash
   sudo su ec2-user
   nitro-cli console --enclave-name signing_server
   ```

   You should see a similar output like this:
   ```bash
   viproxy: 2024/03/19 13:08:00 viproxy.go:98: Accepted incoming connection from 127.0.0.1:43970.
   viproxy: 2024/03/19 13:08:00 viproxy.go:108: Dispatched forwarders for 127.0.0.1:5432 <-> vm(3):8001.
   (1, 'master_key', 'Super important key')
   (2, 'secondary_key', 'Less important key')
   (3, 'backup_key', 'Somehow important key')
   viproxy: 2024/03/19 13:08:00 viproxy.go:136: Closed connection tuple for 127.0.0.1:43970 <-> vm(3):8001.
   ```

   This tells you that the enclave was able to create a new database schema, inject 3 records and execute a select all. 


## KMS Key Policy

```json5
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Enable decrypt from enclave",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": <devNitroWalletEth.EC2InstanceRoleARN>
      },
      "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEqualsIgnoreCase": {
          "kms:RecipientAttestation:ImageSha384": <PCR0_VALUE_FROM_EIF_BUILD>
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Enable encrypt from lambda",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": <devNitroWalletEth.LambdaExecutionRoleARN>
      },
      "Action": "kms:Encrypt",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": <KMS_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE_ARN>
      },
      "Action": [
        "kms:Create*",
        "kms:Describe*",
        "kms:Enable*",
        "kms:List*",
        "kms:Put*",
        "kms:Update*",
        "kms:Revoke*",
        "kms:Disable*",
        "kms:Get*",
        "kms:Delete*",
        "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion",
        "kms:CancelKeyDeletion",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey",
        "kms:TagResource",
        "kms:UntagResource"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

To leverage the provided `generate_key_policy.sh` script, a CDK output file needs to be provided.
This file can be created by running the following command:

```bash
cdk deploy devNitroWalletEth -O output.json
```

After the `output.json` file has been created, the following command can be used to create the KMS key policy:

```bash
./script/generate_key_policy.sh ./output.json
```

If the debug mode has been turned on by appending `--debug-mode` to the enclaves start sequence, the enclaves PCR0 value
in the AWS KMS key policy needs to be updated
to `000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`,
otherwise AWS KMS will return error code `400`.

## Key Generation and Requests

### Create Ethereum Key

Use the command below to create a temporary Ethereum private key.

```bash
openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -noout | openssl ec -text -noout > key
cat key | grep priv -A 3 | tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n[:space:]:' | sed 's/^00//'
```

Use the following command to calculate the corresponding public address for your temporary Ethereum key created in the
previous step.
[keccak-256sum](https://github.com/maandree/sha3sum) binary needs to be made available to execute the calculation step
successfully.

```bash
cat key | grep pub -A 5 | tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n[:space:]:' | sed 's/^04//' > pub
echo "0x$(cat pub | keccak-256sum -x -l | tr -d ' -' | tail -c 41)"
```

Please be aware that the calculated public address does not comply with the valid mixed-case checksum encoding standard
for Ethereum addresses specified in [EIP-55](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md).

### Set Ethereum Key

Replace the Ethereum key placeholder in the JSON request below and use the request to encrypt and store the Ethereum key
via the Lambda `test` console:

```json
{
  "operation": "set_key",
  "eth_key": <ethereum_key_placeholder>
}
```

### Sign EIP-1559 Transaction

Use the request below to sign an Ethereum EIP-1559 transaction with the saved Ethereum key using the Labda `test`
console:

```json
{
  "operation": "sign_transaction",
  "transaction_payload": {
    "value": 0.01,
    "to": "0xa5D3241A1591061F2a4bB69CA0215F66520E67cf",
    "nonce": 0,
    "type": 2,
    "chainId": 4,
    "gas": 100000,
    "maxFeePerGas": 100000000000,
    "maxPriorityFeePerGas": 3000000000
  }
}
```

## Cleaning up

Once you have completed the deployment and tested the application, clean up the environment to avoid incurring extra
cost. This command removes all resources in this stack provisioned by the CDK:

```bash
cdk destroy
```
